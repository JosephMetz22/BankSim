# BankSim

Bank simulation file that lets users check, deposit, and withdraw from their account.

All client information is read from and written to a text file.

Implements a java interface in at least two seperate classes, representing savings and checking accounts.

At start up, the program should read in appropriate bank account records from a file (user, password, type of account, balances, etc.), create an appropriate data structure to hold the proper bank account objects, and provide a menu for customers to log in and execute transactions.  Before the program exits, saves the current state of the accounts back to your data file.

Catches any exceptions that may be thrown.
